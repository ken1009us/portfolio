This is my portfolio built with TypeScript, Next.js and Tailwind CSS .

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
$ npm run dev
# or
$ yarn dev
# or
$ pnpm dev
```

Then

```bash
$ nvm install --lts
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
